Tested with Vagrant 1.5.4 and VirtualBox 4.3.10.

This is a simple example of how to build a virtual test environment with Vagrant and Puppet.

The setup contains a virtual machine with a database server with MySQL, an Apache2 webserver and an application server with Tomcat 7.
Beside that it includes a phpmyadmin environment. 
Since this vm is configured only for development purposes it is strongly recommended not to use it for productive environments. 

Prerequisites:
 * Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/)
 * VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
 


Simply check it out, chdir into the directory and then run

 > vagrant up

to start the box.

You'll then have your application server at http://33.33.33.10:8080.
PhpMyAdmin is available at http://33.33.33.10/phpmyadmin. (No password for root!)

Database user/password: dbuser/dbuser
Tomcat-manager: manager/manager


Enjoy!

When you're done, don't forget to stop your virtual boxes with

 > vagrant halt

or completely remove them with

 > vagrant destroy


 Problems:
 Sometimes the VBGuestAdditions are outdated. Then you can update it by 
 vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

 Afterwards ssh into your vm and ensure:
 sudo ln -s /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-4.3.10/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions /usr/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions
 

 run
 $ vagrant reload
